# 🌐 Week 2: Computer Networking

Welcome to Week 2 of the Teknikally Speaking Bootcamp!

This week, we’re diving into **how computers talk to each other** — from cables and routers to IP addresses and pings. You’ll get your hands on Cisco Packet Tracer and simulate your own home or office network.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- What is a computer network?
- Types of networks: LAN, WAN, PAN, MAN, Internet
- IP addresses, MAC addresses, and protocols
- Devices: routers, switches, access points
- Common networking terms: DNS, DHCP, TCP/IP
- Cisco Packet Tracer (simulation tool)

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Activity: Network Design Lab
Use **Cisco Packet Tracer** to build a basic network.

Include:
- 2–3 computers
- A switch and a router
- Manual IP address setup
- Test connections using `ping` tool

---

## 💼 Project Submission Options
Choose one of the following formats:
- 📄 **Written Report** (Markdown or Google Docs)
- 📸 **Network Diagram Screenshot**
- 🎥 **Video Walkthrough** (Loom or YouTube)

---

## 📁 Deliverables
- `my-network-lab-reflection.md`: Brief explanation of your design and what you learned
- Screenshot or file of your Packet Tracer project (`.pkt`)
- Bonus: `bonus-notes.md` with any additional learning
